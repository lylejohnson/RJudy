RJudy was a Ruby extension module that provided an interface to
the [Judy arrays](http://judy.sourceforge.net/) library. It is no
longer maintained, but the sources are provided here for historical
purposes.

Judy was originally implemented at Hewlett-Packard, and was subsequently
open-sourced in June 2002 (with an LGPL license). Doug Baskins, the author
of the Judy algorithm, has written a
[nice summary](http://judy.sourceforge.net/doc/10minutes.htm)
of what makes Judy arrays so fast, and why you might want to use them.
